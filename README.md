# Flat Data Demo: XLSX to CSV

This demo is part of a larger Flat Data project created by Github Research. Read more about it [here](https://octo.github.com/blog/flat-data).

## What this demo does

This repository uses a [Flat Data Action](https://octo.github.com/blog/flat-data) to fetch a XLSX file from an http endpoint every 15 minutes.

Using a postprocessing script, Flat converts the XLSX file to a CSV file.

## Postprocessing

Refer to the [Flat postprocessing library](https://github.com/githubocto/flat-postprocessing) for more helper functions and examples for writing postprocessing scripts.
